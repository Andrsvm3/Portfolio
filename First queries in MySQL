These are small queries that are within a MySQL training that I am doing on a database called "employees" and which consists of several tables

EXERCISE 1 --> AVERAGE SALARY OF MEN AND WOMEN BY DEPARTMENT
SELECT
	e.gender,
    AVG(s.salary) as avg_salary,
    d.dept_name
FROM 
	employees e
    JOIN
    salaries s ON e.emp_no = s.emp_no
    JOIN
    dept_emp de ON e.emp_no = de.emp_no
    JOIN 
    departments d ON de.dept_no = d.dept_no
GROUP BY de.dept_no, e.gender
ORDER BY de.dept_no;


EXERCISE 2 --> FIND THE LOWEST AND HIGHEST DEPARTMENT NUMBER

SELECT
	MIN(dept_no) AS min_dept_no,
    MAX(dept_no) AS max_dept_no
FROM
	dept_emp;


EXERCISE 3 --> LIST OF ALL EMPLOYEES WHO WERE HIRED IN 2000
SELECT 
	emp_no,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    hire_date
FROM 
	employees
WHERE 
	YEAR(hire_date) = 2000;


EXERCISE 4 --> LISTADO EMPLEADOS QUE SON INGENIEROS
SELECT 
	e.emp_no,
    e.first_name,
    e.last_name,
    t.title
FROM
	employees e
    JOIN
    titles t ON e.emp_no = t.emp_no
WHERE title = "Engineer";

EXERCISE 5 --> LIST OF EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE DIFFERENT ENGINEER POSITIONS
SELECT
	*
FROM 
	titles
WHERE
	title LIKE '%engineer%';
